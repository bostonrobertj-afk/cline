# Step 5: Validate & Complete

## META
- managed_workflow_extraction: enabled
- phase_type: phase
- source_format: procedural

## EXECUTION
<step n="1" goal="Review Detailed Guidance">
  <action>Read the advisory, reference, and prose sections in this file completely before taking action.</action>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Follow Phase Procedure">
  <action>Execute this file in order, preserving every approval gate, routing rule, document update instruction, and constraint described below.</action>
</step>

## CHECKPOINT
This phase can be marked complete only after the required outputs, approvals, and routing conditions in this file are satisfied.

## ADVISORY
- Treat the <prose> section as the authoritative detailed instructions for this file.
- Preserve all existing user-input pauses, continuation checks, and referenced companion files.
- Keep any document templates, frontmatter updates, and save instructions exactly as authored.

## REFERENCE
- Original authored procedure retained below for managed workflow extraction compatibility.

<prose>
## STEP GOAL

Validate ATDD outputs and provide a completion summary.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`
- ✅ Validate against the checklist

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Validation

Use `checklist.md` to validate:

- Prerequisites satisfied
- Test files created correctly
- Checklist matches acceptance criteria
- Tests are designed to fail before implementation
- [ ] CLI sessions cleaned up (no orphaned browsers)
- [ ] Temp artifacts stored in `{test_artifacts}/` not random locations

Fix any gaps before completion.

---

## 2. Polish Output

Before finalizing, review the complete output document for quality:

1. **Remove duplication**: Progressive-append workflow may have created repeated sections — consolidate
2. **Verify consistency**: Ensure terminology, risk scores, and references are consistent throughout
3. **Check completeness**: All template sections should be populated or explicitly marked N/A
4. **Format cleanup**: Ensure markdown formatting is clean (tables aligned, headers consistent, no orphaned references)

---

## 3. Completion Summary

Report:

- Test files created
- Checklist output path
- Key risks or assumptions
- Next recommended workflow (e.g., implementation or `automate`)

---

## 4. Save Progress

**Save this step's accumulated work to `{outputFile}`.**

- **If `{outputFile}` does not exist** (first save), create it with YAML frontmatter:

  ```yaml
  ---
  stepsCompleted: ['step-05-validate-and-complete']
  lastStep: 'step-05-validate-and-complete'
  lastSaved: '{date}'
  ---
  ```

  Then write this step's output below the frontmatter.

- **If `{outputFile}` already exists**, update:
  - Add `'step-05-validate-and-complete'` to `stepsCompleted` array (only if not already present)
  - Set `lastStep: 'step-05-validate-and-complete'`
  - Set `lastSaved: '{date}'`
  - Append this step's output to the appropriate section.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.
