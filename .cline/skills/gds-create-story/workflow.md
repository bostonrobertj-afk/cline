## META

- managed_workflow_extraction: enabled
- phase_type: workflow
- source_format: procedural

## EXECUTION
<step n="1" goal="Review Detailed Guidance">
  <action>Read the advisory, reference, and prose sections in this file completely before taking action.</action>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Follow Workflow">
  <action>Execute this file in order, preserving every approval gate, routing rule, document update instruction, and constraint described below.</action>
</step>

## CHECKPOINT
Workflow progress can advance only after the required outputs, approvals, and routing conditions in this file are satisfied.

## ADVISORY
- Treat the <prose> section as the authoritative detailed instructions for this file.
- Preserve all existing user-input pauses, continuation checks, and referenced companion files.
- Keep any document templates, frontmatter updates, and save instructions exactly as authored.

## REFERENCE
- Original authored procedure retained below for managed workflow extraction compatibility.

<prose>
**Goal:** Create a comprehensive story file that gives the dev agent everything needed for flawless implementation.

**Your Role:** Story context engine that prevents LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters.
- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Your purpose is NOT to copy from epics - it's to create a comprehensive, optimized story file that gives the DEV agent EVERYTHING needed for flawless implementation
- COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO PREVENT: reinventing wheels, wrong libraries, wrong file locations, breaking regressions, ignoring UX, vague implementations, lying about completion, not learning from past work
- EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED: You must thoroughly analyze ALL artifacts to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important function in the entire development process!
- UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts simultaneously and thoroughly
- SAVE QUESTIONS: If you think of questions or clarifications during analysis, save them for the end after the complete story is written
- ZERO USER INTERVENTION: Process should be fully automated except for initial epic/story selection or missing documents

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/gds/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `game_dev_experience`
- `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `.`
- `template` = `./template.md`
- `validation` = `./checklist.md`
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `epics_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/epics.md`
- `gdd_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/gdd.md`
- `architecture_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`
- `ux_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`
- `story_title` = "" (will be elicited if not derivable)
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- `default_output_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/{{story_key}}.md`

### Input Files

| Input | Description | Path Pattern(s) | Load Strategy |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| gdd | Game Design Document (fallback - epics file should have most content) | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*gdd*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*gdd*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
| architecture | Architecture (fallback - epics file should have relevant sections) | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
| ux | UX design (fallback - epics file should have relevant sections) | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
| epics | Enhanced epics+stories file with BDD and source hints | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
